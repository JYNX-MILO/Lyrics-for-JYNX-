So good, you gonna get lost in the moment
Lay back I'll show you how I control it
Tongue tied and you're caught up in the moment
Don't speak 'cause you might ruin when I 'Shh'
A little bit of hot, a little bit of heat
You can ride the rainbow, it's your fantasy
A little bit of hot, a little bittersweet
Once you taste the heavens, you won't wanna leave
I got you like
Come on baby, close your eyes
Let the feelin' take you high
(Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
Cherry sky
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
Now that you realize what you been missin'
Might let you get more if you keep wishin'
Pink stars in your eyes cause it hit different
Don't rush 'cause you might ruin when I 'Shh'
A little bit of hot, a little bit of heat
You can ride the rainbow, it's your fantasy
A little bit of hot, a little bittersweet
Once you taste the heavens, you won't wanna leave
I got you like
Come on baby, close your eyes
Let the feelin' take you high
(Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
Cherry sky
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
I got you like
Come on baby, close your eyes
Let the feelin' take you high
(Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
Cherry sky
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
(Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye)
Come on baby, take a dive
Swimming through the cherry sky
