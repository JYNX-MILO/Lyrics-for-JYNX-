Breath, I don't wanna back down
You been playin' too loud
Hey, you better watch out
Now I'm turning' you down
Oh, you're the one who sees me through the noise
I'll be right on your freq
So close to you, 더 느리게
시계침 조차도 머뭇거리게
Oh, slow to move, let me fade your pain, baby
So we don't need to learn, we don't need to learn about love
Ooh, now you know that
Ooh
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
We move it, make it right
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
You know how, go go
Ooh
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
Look so good when we are
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
You know how, go, go
Yeah, I don't explain I just exist
앞에 보이는 거울에 비친
But 주윌 망치는
Lovely (cranky) grumpy (freaky) 그또한 예술처럼
But you're the one who sees me through the noise
I'll be right on your freq
So close to you, 더 느리게
시계침조차도 머뭇거리게
Oh, slow to move
Let me hold your shade baby
So you already know, you already know about love
Ooh, here we go now
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
We move it, make it right
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
You know how, go, go
Ooh
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
Look so good when we are
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
You know how, go, go
If you're still right here
You know, then I don't disappear
기나긴 시간 지나서
결국 아름답게 피어난
Dirty
I'll show you how to be dirty
I'll teach you how to be dirty
Don't worry 'bout that worry, worry, worry, worry
Dirty
I'll show you how to be dirty
I'll teach you how to be dirty
그 끝은 결국
No crown without
Ooh
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
We move it, make it right
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
You know how, go go
Ooh
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-dirty, baby
Look so good when we are
Dirty, baby, dirty, dir-
That's our legacy
