World domination
I don’t gotta say it
전엔 없던
돌연변이 같아
저주야 난
다수로 볼 땐
Set ‘em on fire
스스로 밝혀

And I don’t really care if you
like me, like me
I don’t really wanna play
nicely, nicely
오답을 고른 게
정답인 선택
Open your eyes,
come and
Bite me

Sharp teeth,
bite first
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Bold eyes,
cold stare
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work

Work, work, work, work
work, work, work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work

I’m not an it girl
more like a hit girl
Mafia ties going
back to the old world
Fear in their eyes
I’m always watching
Call me the reaper
I’m knock knock knocking

It’s me, it’s me,
a little baddie
Just ‘cause
I’m pretty doesn’t mean
I don’t do hard things
Hard things,
make me feel like a thunder
Let me think 뭐를 하든
I will like it, like it

Sharp eyes,
fierce look
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Hold tight,
get tough
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work
Real bad business,
that’s Dirty Work

We don’t see you as a threat
얄팍한 Rule 따윈
한 겹의 Glass
내 맘대로 해
깨트려 내
쉽게 난 두 발로
그 위를 Pass Yeah
Kick up the dust,
let ’em talk about it
Crawl out the mud,
let ’em know about it
번뇌를 깨우는 음률 속에
두 눈을 봐
Well you already found it

Drop it
low low low low low low
Work it out work it out
Drop it
low low low low low low
Work it out work it out
Drop it
low low low low low low
Work it out work it out
Drop it
low low low low low low
Work it out work it out
(Work It)

Sharp teeth,

Bold eyes,
