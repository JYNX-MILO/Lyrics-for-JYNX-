Yeah
Love 빌어먹을 four letters
Love 으로 포장해 넌 매번
Selfish, I will never be enough
내 모든 걸 쏟아부어도 oh-oh-oh
끝없는 war
또 끝없이 more
네 겨냥이 틀리지 않게
날카로운 말
Like bullets they are
I won't surrender my darling
I don't give a damn about you
When you say, yeah
I don't a give a damn about you
It's pain
As long as you love me
The good or the ugly
무엇이든 다 괜찮아
It's like you control me
Without you I'm lonely
하지만 넌 다르잖아
Your words are like a gun shot
I'm bleeding love
They hit me like a gun shot
I'm bleeding love
You hit me like a
You hit me like a, yeah
I'm feeling like I'm in 폐허
Break it 두 눈 감았던 폐해
그간 넌 본색을 은폐해
이젠 네 족쇄서 탈피해 (벌거벗는데도)
In your all tricks
발목 잡은 trap
나를 거기서 꺼내어내
주마등은 삭제해
너라는 꼬리푤 떼어내 yeah
Whoa (whoa), answer when I'm calling
Whoa (whoa) 너 없이 dying slowly
뱉어낸 네 말은 날 죽여 like bullets
나 아닌 그 trigger, trigger 감싸고 pull it
As long as you love me
The good or the ugly
무엇이든 다 괜찮아
It's like you control me
Without you I'm lonely
하지만 넌 아니잖아
Your words are like a gun shot
I'm bleeding love
They hit me like a gun shot
I'm bleeding love
Baby, this love
I'm bleeding
너를 위해
Oh, no
No love
멀리해
나를 위해
No more, oh, oh, oh
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
더 견뎌낼 수 없어 나를 위해서라도
너의 gun (너의 gun)
Shot (shot)
I'm bleeding love
Your words are like a gun shot (shot)
I'm bleeding love
They hit me like a gun shot (shot)
I've bled enough
