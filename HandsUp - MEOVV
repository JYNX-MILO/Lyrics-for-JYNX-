이 길로 갈게
We gotta see above, okay
We back on track
이미 백번째 나를 dead it
뜨거운 햇빛처럼 lit it
Samadhi, we burn again
네 위를 봐, you can't deny
막힘 없지, 더 묻지 마
Do what you please, 거침없게
Don't cross the li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-line
One, two, three, set it off
Try and catch up, 수평 너머로
높이 용 솟음 쳐, 마법같은 purr
이래 저래 해도, 넌 'bout it, 'bout that, no, you not
So what we gonna do?
I see you, look at me now
Hands up
Crack the sky open, put your hands up
Break the sky, let the water fall
손 위로 답을 몰라도, throw it up, what you wanna do?
Hands up
Crack the sky open, put your hands up
Break the sky, let the water fall
손 위로 답을 몰라도, throw it up, what you wanna do?
이 길로 갈게
We gotta see above, okay
We back on track
이미 백번째 나를 dead it
뜨거운 햇빛처럼 lit it
Samadhi, we burn again
Provocation ain't nothing new to me
휘둘러 봐 네 녹슨 sword
질투 가득한 admiration
Self-affirmation, yet still unsure
번쩍 뜨일거야 두 눈이
Me and my girls you dealin' with
So 아리따운 killin', 잔인한 willin'
Hands up, who the real villain?
내 안의 불씨들 won't let it die
꺼지진 않겠어, I will survive
이래 저래 해도, 넌 'bout it, 'bout that, no, you not
So what we gonna do?
I see you, look at me now
Hands up
Crack the sky open, put your hands up
Break the sky, let the water fall
손 위로 답을 몰라도, throw it up, what you wanna do?
Hands up
Crack the sky open, put your hands up
Break the sky, let the water fall
손 위로 답을 몰라도, throw it up, what you wanna do?
불타는 마음 (마음) 다 태워봐 (봐)
어차피 또 피어날 테니까
이제 다시 거슬러 위로 아래로 다 뒤집어
Let that drum go rum-pu-pu-pum
Hands up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
Crack the sky open, put your-
Hands up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
Crack the sky open, put your-
Crack the sky open, put your-
Break the sky open, put your hands up
