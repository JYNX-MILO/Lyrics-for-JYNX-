Hey
You're runnin' from what you can't escape
Come my way
I'll put you under some kind of state, astray
So watch me hypnotize you with my eyes (my eyes)
Make you fantasize 'bout me tonight
I'm hypnotizing (come on now)
Whoa
Whoa-ooh
Whoa
Hypnotizing
Whoa
Whoa-ooh
Side to side, got you hypnotized
(Ooh, yeah)
'Cause every time my clock, tick-tock like this
Every little spell I cast, don't miss (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Always on top, top, top
I'm hypnotizing (ooh, yeah)
Got you doing what I want, want, want all night
Wake up to the click of sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Follow with your eyes
Watch me, watch me hypnotize
You'll be where I want you every night
You'll be back to feed your appetite
Swirling, hypno, disco, illusion
My command becomes your reason
In your consciousness
Now your mind is of no consequence
I bet you never seen a girl so confident
Cut the compliments, that's just common sense
So watch me hypnotize you with my eyes
Make you fantasize about me tonight
I'm hypnotizing
Whoa
Whoa-ooh
Whoa
Hypnotizing
Whoa
Whoa-ooh
Side to side, got you hypnotized
(Ooh, yeah)
'Cause every time my clock, tick-tock like this
Every little spell I cast, don't miss (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Always on top, top, top
I'm hypnotizing (ooh, yeah)
Got you doing what I want, want, want all night
Wake up to the click of sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Follow with your eyes
Watch me, watch me hypnotize
When you fall asleep, what do you see?
I know it's me
Make you fantasize about me tonight (dreams when you're fast asleep, it's all we have)
You wake and stare like you're lost in the room
Too late, too bad, boy, you know what to do
Now you're playing my game, I keep you doing my favors
Side to side, got you hypnotized
'Cause every time my clock, tick-tock like this (every time we kiss)
Every little spell I cast, don't miss (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Always on top, top, top
I'm hypnotizing (I'm hypnotizing)
Got you doing what I want, want, want all night (whoa, oh, yeah, oh)
Wake up to the click of sound (alright)
Follow with your eyes
Watch me, watch me hypnotize
