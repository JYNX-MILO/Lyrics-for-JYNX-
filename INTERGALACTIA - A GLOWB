RUM-PUM-PUM-PUM
Like the beating kick drum
Entering your system
I'm a sickness symptom
Hate, addiction
Make your mind up, pick one
This is more than fiction
Just a heads up, baby
Name any game and I'll play it like a champ
Cries of my enemies setting the ambience
Thoughts in retrospect suck
So I'm never giving a what
No, I say what I think
Doing nothing never made anyone
I've travelled so far just to find a home
We're lightyears apart but I won't lose hope
There's more to the stars than the things we know
I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
When darkness surrounds us, where do we go?
I can't hear a sound, not even my own
But I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
We are, we are, we are
INTERGALACTIA
Am I wrong if I don't want to wait?
And if I trust myself more than the ones I face?
If I feel like the universe ain't got nothing on me?
I could swallow it whole
Chew it up with my teeth
Name any game and I'll win it 'cuz I can
Success in my genes, baby
I don't need a plan
Thoughts in retrospect suck
So I'm never giving a what
No, I say what I think
Doing nothing never made anyone
I've travelled so far just to find a home
We're lightyears apart but I won't lose hope
There's more to the stars than the things we know
I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
When darkness surrounds us, where do we go?
I can't hear a sound, not even my own
But I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
We are, we are, we are
INTERGALACTIA
You wanna come at me?
I'm not the one, you see
Only one guarantee
I choose my destiny
I've travelled so far just to find a home
We're lightyears apart but I won't lose hope (I'm never losing hope)
There's more to the stars than the things we know
I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
When darkness surrounds us, where do we go?
I can't hear a sound, not even my own
But I feel in my heart that I'm not alone
We are, we are, we are
INTERGALACTIA
Eh-eh

Oh-oh

Haa

Oh-oh
