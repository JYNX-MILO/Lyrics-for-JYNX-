'm not that easy to tame
You should see me under these lights, all my tears turn to ice
That's the sweetest escape
Every time the feelin' kicks in, I might stay through the night
Bet you get it now, rocked that, didn't I?
착각 하지 마 누가 누군지
Whoa, think you're runnin' that? Guess we gunnin' back
You know I walk it, yeah, I talk it, 눈 감고 하나, 둘, 셋 (뛰어)
뛰어, 뛰어
뛰어, 뛰어
So come up with me, I'll take you high
That prima donna spice up your life
You know I got that shit that you like
So come up with me, run up, uh, jump (뛰어)
Watch me runnin' up the place
I'm already stuntin', and my girls are on the way (뛰어)
Watch me open up the place
Wanna see you bumpin', baby, bouncin' to the bass
Are you not entertained? (No) I ain't gotta explain (no)
I'm with all of my sisters (ah), got 'em goin' insane, yeah (yeah)
You know we on a mission (yeah) all gas, no brakes, yeah (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Breakin' outta the system, breakin' outta this cage, yeah
Bet you get it now, ate that, didn't I?
순간 잊지 마 누가 누군지, oh
Think you runnin' that? Guess we gunnin' back
You know I walk it, yeah, I talk it, 눈 감고 하나, 둘, 셋 (뛰어)
뛰-뛰-뛰어
뛰어
뛰어
뛰어
So come up with me, I'll take you high
That prima donna spice up your life
You know I got that shit that you like
So come up with me, run up, uh, jump (뛰어)
Watch me runnin' up the place
I'm already stuntin', and my girls are on the way (뛰어)
Watch me open up the place
Wanna see you bumpin', baby, bouncin' to the bass
