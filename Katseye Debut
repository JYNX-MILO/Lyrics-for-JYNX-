La, la-la
La-la-la, la, la
La, la-la
La-la-la, la, la

I-I-I don't need no one-two-three, not Bourgeoisie, I'll step in
Know just how to make a scene, just me, myself, my best friends
Uh-huh, I like it, it's simple as that (That's right)
Uh-huh, I like it, I keep coming back (Huh, uh)
I don't need nobody, tryna tell me how to run it
Found myself some baddies, 'bout to turn it to a hundred
Uh-huh, they like it, it's simple as that (That's right)
Uh-huh, they like it, they keep coming back

Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin', babe, we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come through
We can run it, run it, run it, no, this ain't a debut
Love me once, I know you'll love me twice
Love me once, the naughty turns to nice

La, la-la
La-la-la, la, la (Ayy)

I don't need no cookie cutter, perfect ordinary (No)
Can find me under ride or die inside that dictionary (Babe)
Uh-huh, they like it, it's simple as that (That's right)
Uh-huh, they like it, they keep coming back

Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin', babe, we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come through
We can run it, run it, run it, no, this ain't a debut
Love me once, I know you'll love me twice
Love me once, the naughty turns to nice
Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin', babe, we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come through
We can run it, run it, run it, no, this ain't a debut
Love me once, I know you'll love me twice
Love me once, the naughty turns to nice

La, la-la
La-la-la, la, la
La, la-la
La, love me once, I know you'll love me twice
La, la-la
La-la-la, la, la
Love me once, I know you'll love me twice
Love me once, it's time to roll the dice
