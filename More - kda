Should we show ’em how we do it everyday
(na na na na na na na na na na)
Let’s get it

Akali that girl, Kali go grr
Kali don’t stop, Kali don’t skrr
Kali got a job, Kali go to work
뜨거워 언제나, don’t get burnt
넘쳐흘러 more than a buffet
난 죽여 주잖아 like I’m Buffy
누가 감히 on my huffy
거-문 열지 마 that’s a rough day
I’m giving you more cause I’m greater than
필요없는 시험들, 답은 이미
But all of my numbers are talking babe
부루마블 mrs 모노폴리
너는 – 종이 돈이 나는 real money
필요 없대 너네들이 많은 돈들
Go get it go get it go get it the mission
눈을 못 떼 모두 그래 너도 그래
Cause I got it different

All I’ll ever know
Is life up on a throne
시작하면 끝을 보는 거야
You want

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
[LL/All] More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
[LL/All] Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, all the time

When I go it’s for gold
Yeah they cool but I’m cold
I don’t fit in the mold
I’m a rebel
I don’t do what you say
Making moves I don’t wait
While I smile in your face
I got different DNA

What’s higher than the top, that’s me
Come take a look
Before falling at my feet
조용히 몸을 숙여봐
So take a look
나를 기억해 a queen

All I’ll ever know
Is life up on a throne
시작하면 끝을 보는 거야
You want

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
[LL/All] More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
[LL/All] Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, all the time

Way out
感觉犹如海浪, on the wave now
不断往前遨游, never weighed down
This is how I do it everyday
Wow, wow
这一路上的奇迹
都记住了你的
每一个瞬间, 无 比 的 耀 眼
I know I know, you want some more
准备好就一起走
Giving it all

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
[LL/All] More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
[LL/All] Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, all the time
