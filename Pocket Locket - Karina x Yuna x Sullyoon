'm your type, I'm the vibe

Fantasize, stay the night, every night
I can keep all your secrets
in my pocket locket
And then I keep ya held down
when I lock and drop it

 Yeah, you be sly,
that's all right, I don't mind
you be cruel, I'll survive
playing that hard to get love
showing no affection
I know it's hard to keep up
with my good intention


 You must think
I'm mad to need ya
They must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end
you'll be the one~ one~ one~

Right now I bet you think
you've got me in the palm of your hands
Give me no love, you get that good love
hope that you don't regret


 Taking so long to see that
I'm the best thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy
get that good love, baby
while you still can


 I'm the hit, I'm a trip
Take a sip, watch it drip from your lip
Know that I can keep you
held down with my little finger
And I would do it all day
just to let you linger

 You know that I
would take the time to let you ride
let you try, to do me right
Hoping that you're learnin' real quick
asking all the questions
'Cause if you push me too far
you gon' learn your lesson

 Right now I bet you think
you've got me in the palm of your hands
Give me no love, you get that good love
hope that you don't regret

 Taking so long to see that
I'm the best thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy
get that good love, baby
while you still can

 I'm your type, I'm the vibe
Fantasize, stay the night, every night
I can keep all your secrets
in my pocket locket
And then I keep ya held down
when I lock and drop it

Yeah, you be sly, that's all right
I don't mind, you be cruel, I'll survive
playing that hard to get love
showing no affection
I know it's hard to keep up
with my good intention


 Oh, baby, while you still can
That love, boy, get that good love
 While you still can~ oh~ yeah~
Come get that love, boy
get that good love
 While you still can
