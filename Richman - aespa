내 것을 탐내, see, my name is
Where my name is (I am a rich man)
That's me, 나는 reckless (yeah)
굳은 멘탈, 그것쯤 웃네 (what?)
내가 날 이끌어 가, 보여, 다음 sign
별거 아냐, exit is my next step
딴생각 말고, self-belief, 'cause 그게 훨씬 재미있지

Don't need the money, yeah, I see it
In my closet, my ideas
내 말버릇, 내 걸음, 내 이름
You know, when I'm serving them looks, I'ma feed 'em
