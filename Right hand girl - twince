I said I’m on my way
But I’m already outside
Girl come and hop up in a big ride
Don’t be messing up your eyeliner
For somebody whose was a part-timer
Let’s go heavy on the mood fired up
Trust me it’ll make you feel lighter

Get the rhythm in your mind
And make your body whine whine
Umm yeah the rhythm got you high
You dancing all night night

Take it take it take it all baby
Get it get it yeah we can worry later
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl
Take it take it take it all baby (Oh)
Get it get it yeah we can worry later (Oh)
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour (Oh)
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl

In the meantime you need time for me-time na-na-na
Time to breathe and step aside na-na-na
That melody a remedy
Drowning out every memory is what you need na-na-na

And when I drop my oh my behind
Know you gon’ follow let your hips unwind girl
Ain’t leaving your your side
Till you dance that boy right outta your life

Get the rhythm in your mind
And make your body whine whine
Umm yeah the rhythm got you high
You dancing all night night

Take it take it take it all baby
Get it get it yeah we can worry later
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl
Take it take it take it all baby (Oh)
Get it get it yeah we can worry later (Oh)
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour (Oh)
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl

Who gonna be there when the tears come running
Who gonna be there when there ain’t no fun and
Who gonna love you through the thick and the thin
Ah-ha your right-hand girl
Who gonna be there when the tears come running
Who gonna be there when there ain’t no fun and
Who gonna love you through the thick and the thin
Ah-ha your right-hand girl

Take it take it take it all baby
Get it get it yeah we can worry later
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl
Take it take it take it all baby (Oh)
Get it get it yeah we can worry later (Oh)
Bend it break it on your worst behaviour (Oh)
You don’t need nobody but your right-hand girl
