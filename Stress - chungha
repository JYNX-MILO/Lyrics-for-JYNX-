Ah-ha, yeah
Take it easy (yeah, yeah)
Take it easy, no stress (no stress, no stress)
(No stress, no stress)
One plus one is two
뻔한 규칙들은 빗겨 나가 today (today)
정해준 틀 다 깨트려 봐 봐
D-don't worry about a thing (uh-uh)
Oops, my, oh my, 망설이지 마, don't mumble
Boom, dynamite, 미쳐가 our life's like jungle
Oops, my, oh my, 그만할래, 전부 crumble
Are you ready for it?
Take it easy, no stress (no stress, no stress)
따라 해봐, just dance (no stress, no stress)
Honey, love yourself best (no stress, no stress)
내 모든 complex 다 벗어나, 지금 이 순간, baby, no-
We can break it through, let me see you groove, baby, no stress
Look at you sweeping through, killing move, you look so mighty
원했던 모든 걸, 새로운 널 꽃피워 봐
When you're ready, I'll be right around
네가 뭘 원하던, baby, I'm down
Oops, my, oh my, 고민하지 마, don't struggle
Boom, dynamite, 새로운 my name is trouble
Oops, my, oh my, 보란듯이, 난 next level
Are you ready for it?
Take it easy, no stress (no stress, no stress)
따라 해봐, just dance (no stress, no stress)
Honey, love yourself best (no stress, no stress)
내 모든 complex 다 벗어나, 지금 이 순간, baby, no-
We can break it through, let me see you groove, baby, no-
Right (right), wrong (wrong), I don't care, I live strong (strong)
Play (play), pause (pause), press me your favorite song (whoo)
Fast (fast), slow (slow), vibin' now with the flow (flow)
Love or hate (or hate), are you ready for it?
Take it easy, no stress, ooh (no stress, no stress)
따라 해봐, just dance, ah (no stress, no stress)
Honey, love yourself best (no stress, no stress)
신경 꺼, 네 complex 모두 다 벗어 던져 봐, baby, no stress
We can break it through, let me see you groove, baby, no stress
