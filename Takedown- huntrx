Takedown, takedown
Takedown, down, down, down (HUNTR/X girls to the world)
Takedown, takedown
Takedown, down, down, down (it's a takedown)
So sweet, so easy on the eyes, but hideous on the inside
Whole life spreadin' lies, but you can't hide, baby, nice try
I'm 'bout to switch up these vibes, I finally opened my eyes
It's time to kick you straight back into the night
'Cause I see your real face, and it's ugly as sin
Time to put you in your place 'cause you're rotten within
When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins
I don't think you're ready for the takedown
Break you into pieces in a world of pain 'cause you're all the same
Yeah, it's the takedown
A demon with no feelings don't deserve to live, it's so obvious
I'ma gear up and take you down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down)
I'ma take it down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down), take it down
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, you'll break down like, "What?"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, and it ain't gonna stop
정신을 놓고, 널 짓밟고, 칼을 새겨놔
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin', never miss my shot
When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins
I don't think you're ready for the takedown
당당하게 어둠 앞에 다가서, 다 무너뜨려
Yeah, it's the takedown
A demon with no feelings don't deserve to live, it's so obvious
I'ma gear up and take you down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down)
I'ma take it down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, watch me do it, yeah, ooh)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, ooh)
Oh, you're the master of illusion
나를 속이려 하지 마
Look at all the masses that you're foolin'
But they'll turn on you soon, so how
How can you sleep or live with yourself?
A broken soul trapped in the nastiest shell
영혼 없는 네 목숨을 끊으러, and watch you die-ie-ie
You can try, but you can't hide
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, you'll break down like, "What?"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, and it ain't gonna stop
I'ma cut you open, lose control, then rip out your heart
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin'
I'ma gear up and take you down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, ah)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
I'ma take it down (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, ooh)
It's a takedown (whoa-oh, da-da-da, down, watch me do it, yeah), take it down
