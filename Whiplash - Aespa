Yeah

One look give ‘em Whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 Think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해 Ah
왜 이제야 Know I did that Uh
Day 1 know I been bad Uh
Don’t stop 흔들린 채
무리해도 Can’t touch that
Can’t touch that

Under pressure, body sweating, can you focus (Yeah)
어디서나 거침없어 I’m the coldest
오직 나만이 이 판을 바꿀 Changer
Just close your eyes, breathe in and visualize

One look give ‘em Whiplash

무리해도 Can’t touch that
