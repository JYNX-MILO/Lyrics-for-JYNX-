You know me like no other
다 표현하지 않아도
See me like no other (mm)
And I think I like your point of view
다시 돌아와도 돼
I don't care what other people say
놓지 말아봐 줘
Dreaming of each other
You may be on my mind (mind)
Everyday, baby, say you're mine (mine)
You and me on my mind (mind)
Everywhere, baby, say you're mine (mine)
Cool with you (gotta tell me now)
Cool with you (it just)
Cool with you (haha)
이쯤에서 정말로
너는 어떤 결말로
가려 해? What's the best?
너의 옆에 내가 있을 때
이런 말이 잘 안 나와
이제 더 말하지 않아도 알아
우리 둘이 만든 거리
건너서 여기
You may be on my mind (mind)
Everyday, baby, say you're mine (mine)
You and me on my mind
Everywhere, baby, say you're mine
Cool with you (gotta tell me now)
Cool with you (it just)
Cool with you (haha)
Cool with you (you know me like no other 너랑)
Cool with you (gotta tell me now)
Cool with you (see me like no other, it just)
Cool with you (haha)
