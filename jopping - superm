I don’t even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon’ make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round
Cuz when we jumping it’s popping, we jopping
Jopping
Jopping
Jopping

You know how we get down (jopping)
How we get down (jopping)
How we get down
Cuz when we jumping and popping, we jopping

Step on the floor (start a riot)
Where the competition man it’s looking one-sided
Up like a 7 forty 7 we the flyest
A lifestyle you should try it
So 시작해
Make it last
Front to back yeah, yeah
(Give me that give me that give me that)
The roof’s on fire let it burn to an ash
We gon’ keep it jopping, tell the DJ bring it back

날아봐 like a paraglide
나타나 in a pair of slides
떠나자 out to paradise
건배해 to a better life
Gotta move, watch the money monsoon
Make the crowd go wild in a small room
Let me see you put it all on like a costume
어디까지 번져갈지 몰라

We love to move it, keep it going, don’t stop
It’s in your nature
말해 girl what you want
춤을 춰봐
We go on and on
Champagne life, that’s all you want
Don’t stop letting it go cuz we got that glow

You know how we get down (jopping)
How we get down (jopping)
How we get down
Cuz when we jumping it’s popping, we jopping

I don’t even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon’ make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round
Cuz when we jumping it’s popping, we jopping

You think ya big boi, throwing three stacks
I’mma a show you how to ball, you a mismatch
Opinionated but I’m always spitting straight facts
Throwback, I might throw this on an 8 track
믿어봐 I’m sight to see
Exciting go and drop the beat
We get it jopping the party, it don’t stop
축제는 이제부터 시작이니까

이 곳이 파티인데 바삐 어딜 가
We’ll keep it jumping and popping here all night
Jump to the front if you want it
Hands up 손을 위로
Don’t stop letting it go, like you don’t care

I don’t even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon’ make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round

모두 hear that sound
틀을 벗어난 하나된 신세계를 펼쳐
Play the music loud
살아나 cuz tonight’s gonna set you free

I don’t even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right, we gon’ make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round

I don’t even care 한껏 달아오른 stage
Left to the right, we gon’ make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air, let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right 시작되는 round

Cuz when we jumping it’s popping, we jopping
Cuz when we jumping it’s popping, we jopping
