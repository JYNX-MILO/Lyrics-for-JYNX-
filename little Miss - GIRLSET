Little miss sweet, little miss cute
Little miss, oof, with the attitude
Little miss nice, but I might bite, don't try
I got a million moods, I'm little miss
Why you lookin' at me like you offended?
All the sugar and spice that I'm blessed with
Got me busy at the top, so what's up?
I'm polite when you're good, but I'm rude when you're not
Can't help but they fall like dominos
Can't help but I'm so phenomenal
I been down, I been down, I been up
Feelin' myself and I can't get enough
Here then gone, chameleon
Soon as you figure me out, I change
If you wanna know who I am
I'll tell you my name
Little miss sweet, little miss cute
Little miss, oof, with the attitude
Little miss nice, but I might bite, don't try
I got a million moods
Little miss hot (hot), little miss cool (cool)
Little miss, let's break all the rules
Little miss nice, but I might bite, don't try
I got a million moods, I'm little miss
Go with the flow
Mess with the energy, big eye roll, oh
Bad vibes, that ain't my type
No, no, no drama when I arrive, oh
Switch on you, I'm seasonal
Picky, but I'm reasonable (what up? Hello, boo)
Texty with my bestie in the group chat
If he feasible
As soon as you figure me out, I change
If you wanna know who I am (who I am, yeah)
I'll tell you my name
Little miss sweet (sweet), little miss cute
Little miss, oof, with the attitude
Little miss nice, but I might bite, don't try
I got a million moods
Little miss hot (hot), little miss cool (cool)
Little miss, let's break all the rules
Little miss nice, but I might bite, don't try
I got a million moods, I'm little miss
Miss, miss, I'm little miss (ah)
Miss, miss, I'm little miss
Miss, miss, I'm little miss (oh)
Miss, miss, I'm little miss (I'm little miss)
