I can feel my heart racing
It's so hard to keep cool
Am I being too patient?
Too hot, got me sweatin' on the floor
(Ooh, sweatin' on the floor)
I just can't take it anymore
(Ooh-ah-ooh, ah-ooh-ah)
(Ah)
And we're so close I can taste it
I see it in your eyes
If there's a chance I'ma take it
I'm begging you, just please give me a sign
Waiting way too long, I think it's time
Mm-hmm-mm
All this magic's burning like a fire inside
And it is way too hot, girl, we should let it
Loose
I've been waiting to get next to you
I can tell how bad you want it too, ooh
All this tension, baby let your body loose (hah)
It's just me and you
Lockin' eyes inside this crowded room
Way you look at me, I can't refuse
All this tension, baby, let your body loose
Yeah, baby
Ponytail sittin' just right
Let it down, girl, don't be shy
I'm just glad we broke that ice
Let's keep on dancing (dancing, dancing)
Baby, I can give it to you however you like
(However you like)
All this magic's burning like a fire inside
And it is way too hot, girl, we should let it
Loose
I've been waiting to get next to you
I can tell how bad you want it too
All this tension, baby, let your body loose (huh)
It's just me and you (me and you)
Lockin' eyes inside this crowded room (crowded room)
Way you look at me, I can't refuse
All this tension, baby, let your body loose
Yeah, baby
I don't wanna waste another second tonight
So in five, four, three, two, one, let's let it
Loose (whoo)
I've been waiting to get next to you (next to you)
I can tell how bad you want it too
All this tension, baby, let your body loose
(Let your body loose, yeah)
It's just me and you (oh, baby)
Lockin' eyes inside this crowded room (lockin' eyes inside this room, yeah)
Way you look at me, I can't refuse (oh-oh)
All this tension, baby, let your body loose (let your body loose)
Yeah, baby
Body loose
