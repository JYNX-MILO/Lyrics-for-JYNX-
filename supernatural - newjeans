Come on (ah-ah)
Come on (let's go)
Stormy night, cloudy sky
In the moment, you and I
One more chance, 너와 나
다시 한번 만나게 서로에게 향하게
My feeling's getting deeper
내 심박수를 믿어
우리 인연은 깊어
I gotta see the meaning of it (come on)
I don't know what we've done
되돌아가긴 싫어, もう知っている
Don't know what we've been sold
見つけられるよ, so it's sure (come on)
Golden moon, diamond stars
In a moment, you and I
Second chance, しょうがない
もう少し待って, 너와 내게 향하게 (ayy)
My feeling's getting deeper (deeper)
내 심박수를 믿어 (믿어)
우리 인연은 깊어 (you know)
I gotta see the meaning of it
I don't know what we've done
되돌아가긴 싫어, もう知っている
Don't know what we've been sold
見つけられるよ, so it's sure
It's supernatural
It's supernatural
거짓말 안 할래, 너도 말해
Attention we should pay, to what is coming through
(To what is coming through) we had no idea (idea)
It's crystal clear, love is here, sitting next to you
私とあなた
Golden moon, diamond stars
In a moment, we unite
