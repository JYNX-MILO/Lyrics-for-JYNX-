I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I don't wanna (wanna)
갈망하고 있는 무언가를 (무언가를)
찾아가고 있어 find out (find out)
끌리는 대로, it's alright, it's alright
멈출 순 없어
So come and take me by the hand, we'll dance all night
아침까지 춤을 출거야
머리부터 발끝까지 다
준비됐어 now, no, no, whoa
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I don't wanna (wanna)
날 가둔 듯 한 이 공간 (공간)
원하면 열어봐 for a while
부드러운 숨이 닿는 순간 (tonight, tonight)
널 미치게 만들 나야
So come and take me by the hand, we'll dance all night
아침까지 춤을 출거야
머리부터 발끝까지 다
준비됐어 now, no, no, whoa
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I don't wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I don't wanna
I've been waiting too long
(아침까지 춤을 출거야) and I don't wanna wait, no more
(I don't wanna, 머리부터 발끝까지 다) take my hand
(준비됐어 now, no, no, whoa) let's go, let's go (I don't wanna)
Don't stop, won't stop
Don't stop, won't stop (I don't wanna)
Don't stop, won't stop
Don't stop, won't stop (I don't wanna)
